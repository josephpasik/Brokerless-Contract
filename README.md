# Overview
In this project, we are helping you break free from broker hassles. Our distributed ledger is built upon ethereum programming in Solidity. Let's walk through this exciting process together!

  * C++
  * Python
  * JavaScript
  * [Auctions](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.9/solidity-by-example.html?highlight=auction)
* Extension installed in Visual Studio Code: **[Link to Github](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity)**

# Next Steps

_**We would like to elaborate on the following aspects on our project:**_

* Duration of contract
* Auction contract should create brokerless contract. 
  * Or contract factory for may empty lease contracts to exist in waiting. 
* Vetting with machine learning
  * Invest deposit with machine learning
* Add damage report 
  * for landlord, require picture submission, allow withdrawal of deposit funds
  * for bidders, from perspectives of a landlord
* Rather than auction process:
  * bidders should offer rent and deposit fee
  * Landlord should be able to choose which to accept
  * Landlord to set minimum
* Add ‚Äúpaper‚Äù contract as URI
  * json
  * pdf
  * png
* Allow tenants to offer a higher security deposit that the landlord is allowed to invest (Ï†ÑÏÑ∏) -> more security for the landlord (better tenants)
* Link with property listing platform
* Late fee (require payRent function even month)
* Events in place for javascript Dapps to listen to
  * For user friendly UI
* Hosting a factory of contracts for multiple apartments: [Example on Github](https://github.com/brynbellomy/solidity-auction/blob/master/contracts/AuctionFactory.sol)
