# Overview
In this project, we are helping you break free from broker hassles. Our distributed ledger is built upon ethereum programming in Solidity. Let's walk through this exciting process together!

## Step-by-step Guide

```
Step 1:
* As Landlord deploys Auction contract 
* As Us deploy Lease contract
* As Us deploy the Omnibus contract

** Insert bank interest 5%

* Set leaseAddress contract
* Set omnibusAddress contract
* As potentialTenant 1 enter bid Value and split Value between 
  rent percent and deposit percent
* As potentialTenant 2 enter higher bid Value and split Value
  between rent percent and deposit percent
* As potentialTenant 1 withdraw bid to get back money
* As Landlord end auction and accept highest bid. Resulting in the rent being transferred
  to lease contract and deposit gets transferred to the Omnibus contract

** Navigate to the Lease contract. As Landlord confirm lease contract
** As Tenant confirm lease contract

* Set Omnibus contract
* Set Previous contract
* Click initialPayout
* Rent payment is transferred to Landlord and Previous Tenant for showing
 the house and Us for offering the platform
** In the Previous Tenant Agreement set 
* Click PayRent 
* After duration press requestDeposit
